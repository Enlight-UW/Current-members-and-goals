# Interview Questions and their Answers:
First some general resources...<br>
<a href="https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig">This github repo has a ton of great info and links.</a><br>
<a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code">The wikipedia of coding algorithms. A great way to practice your algo programming</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions">Web development specific questions</a>

## 04-10-2016: Come up with an algorithm that will return the 'n'th element in the fibonacci sequence.
<br>Example input:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
<br>Example output: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...
<br>For a example solution, <a href="https://github.com/UW-Enlight/Current-members-and-goals/blob/master/fib.py">Look here..</a> note this is not the only way to do this...
Follow up questions: 
- Can you do it a different way?
- Is your way the most efficient?

## 11-10-2016: Come up with and algorithm to compress an input of characters.
<br>For example, if I give you aaaaaaaaabbbbbbaaaaaccccccccfffffhhhhhh
<br> how would you compress that string?
<br> Does your implementation have a worst case senario? How does it handle it?
<br> What is the big O run time of your solution?
<br>Example solution can be found <a href="https://github.com/UW-Enlight/Current-members-and-goals/blob/master/compression.java">Here</a>

## 18-10-2016: Explain the differance between a Java Abstract class, and a Java Interface.
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1913098/what-is-the-difference-between-an-interface-and-abstract-class">See the first and second answer here.</a>

## 25-10-2016: Define the following terms, and their give and example of when you would use them.
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Autoboxing
- struct vs object
- Interface
- static
- public vs private
- final / const
- big O notation
- Assembly vs machine code vs programming language
- what actually happens with an import / #include / using statement?

It will be left to the group / you to come up with or google the definitions.
